<sub><em>**LIABILITY WAIVER  
I understand that the Dartmouth Student Wellness Center (SWC) Yoga/Mindfulness facilitators are here to support my wellbeing by sharing knowledge of yoga, mindfulness and wellbeing practices. I recognize that yoga requires physical activity, which may at times be strenuous. By my participation in SWC classes or workshops, I certify and agree to take full responsibility for listening to my body's feedback so as not to exceed my limits in the practice of yoga. Should any pain occur, I will cease my participation and inform the teacher.  </em></sub>
  
<sub><em>It is my responsibility to ascertain that there is no medical reason to prevent my participation in classes/workshops. I assume full risk for any injuries that I may occur and waive any claim that I might have at the time of the injury of any sort against Dartmouth SWC facilitators or any person or entity in anyway involved therewith-in.  </em></sub>
